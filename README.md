Welcome to Perf Tooling.

Perf Tooling is a shared resource to keep track of new and existent performance tools.

## Contribution

### Adding new tools

You want to add a tool? Great!

Either create an issue and we'll add it to [perf-tooling.today](http://perf-tooling.today).

Or propose a pull request and add a tool by adding a `JSON` file at `data/articles`, `data/slides`, `data/tools` or `data/videos`. The JSON files in these folders will be automatically rendered using a template based in `templates/index.tpl`

_- By proposing a pull request you will be added to the footer contributors list automatically -_

We would like this project to become a shared resource maintained by the community, so if you have any ideas on how to improve it or make it better, please let us know and file an issue. :)

## Kicking off the server to test your changes

Perf Tooling is an [express](http://expressjs.com/) application. If you want to see it in action simply clone the repository and run `npm install`.

After that you can use a couple of npm convenience scripts:

```
# run test suite
$ npm test

# use gulp without global dependency ( e.g. styles )
$ npm run gulp -- styles

# start development build ( including watch )
$ npm run dev

# start dev server with nodemon and restart on file changes
$ npm run server

# old school and simple way to start the app
$ node app.js
```

It will be available at `localhost:3000`.
Be aware of the fact, that the fetching of Github stars may not work, because Github is limiting the number of requests that are allowed without any authorization.
